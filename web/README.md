1. To start the project, run `yarn start`. It will be available at `localhost:3000`.
2. Use `npm install` to add new dependencies. Do not use `yarn add`. This will ensure that our configue file is updated correctly.
3. If `yarn start` fails with error "Could not find a required file. Name: index.js'.", run `npm i -D react-scripts@latest` to update the react script.
